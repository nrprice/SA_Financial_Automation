# SA-Finance-Automation

This is a tool I developed to help automate monthly reporting for my own business. 
It's currently designed to be run locally, so because of the paths won't run without editing. 
## Roadmap

<ul>
<li>Add automation to get the .csv files from the source</li>
<li>Reports for shipping costs vs orders split by country / state - partially completed have merged shipping data with sales data</li>
<li>An interactive dashboard to give more granular control over the data. Would be great to split by product category/country of sale</li>
<li>Able to be run non-locally</li>
</ul>
