# SA-Finance-Automation

This is a tool I developed to help automate monthly reporting for my own business. 
It's currently designed to be run locally, so because of the paths won't run without editing.
The initial .csv files aren't included as they contain sensitive financial and customer information.  
## Roadmap

<ul>
<li>Add automation to get the .csv files from the source</li>
<li>Reports for shipping costs vs orders split by country / state - partially completed have merged shipping data with sales data</li>
<li>An interactive dashboard to give more granular control over the data. Would be great to split by product category/country of sale</li>
<li>Able to be run non-locally</li>
<li>Something is off in how chase / paypal handles transfers in and out of the accounts that needs to be checked.</li>
</ul>
